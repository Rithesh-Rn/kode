The above code is implemented in visual studio 2015. Along with OpenCV 3.1.0
(*before you start, install openCV and add the path of the same to your system)
steps to execute the code on VisualStudio are as follows:

// to run the vehicle detection code

1. Open VisualStudio and create a new project under Visual C++.Click OK.
2. Add 'source.cpp' and 'BLOB.cpp' to the prject.Download the respective video and store it in VisualStudioProject under the folder title your ptoject name.
3. Set solution Configuration to Debug.
4. Set solution platform to x64.
5. Click on Project -> properties -> configuration properties -> VC++ Directories -> include directories -> edit 
6. Now add the path of opencv-build-include (Eg  C:\Users\user\Documents\opencv\build\include).Click OK.
7. Click on Project -> properties -> configuration properties -> VC++ Directories -> library directories -> edit 
8. Now add the path of library directory-openCV (Eg C:\Users\user\Documents\opencv\build\x64\vc14\lib)
9. 7. Click on Project -> properties -> configuration properties -> linker -> Input -> Additional dependencies -> edit
10. Now add the library file(debug). (Ex opencv_world310.lib).Click OK
11. Run the program.

// to run the decision tree code

1. Open VisualStudio(another new window) and create a new project under Visual C++.Click OK.
2. Add 'Decision_tree.cpp' to that project.
3. Run the program.



//***NOTE Run both the simultaneously.



OUTPUT:
example.txt(located in visual studio project folder ): Gives the vehicle count (2-wheeler and 4-wheeler) along with date and time.
signal.txt(Desktop) :Gives the status of traffic signal lights.
